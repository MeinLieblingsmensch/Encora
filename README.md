# Encora

A fully featured RANG (React, ArangoDB, Node and GraphQL) based fullstack framework for React Native, allowing you to create and deploy apps on a web and native platforms alike. Encora also packs with 100+ components for a range of use cases and a theme inspired by "Sirocco" from Foretag.

The goal of the project is to create an ecosystem that bridges the gap between web and native applications and create a performance orientated backend that just plugs and plays for any use case. In the long term, we are looking to incorporate the likes of Game Engines, VR, Maps and more.

## Styling

Each app deserves to be look and feel unique, while the default components allow you to quickly prototype layouts, Encora allows you to have maximum freedom when it comes to styling them to your needs.
